# CodeClause_Churn-Prediction-in-Telecom-Industry-using-Logistic-Regression
### This project uses Logistic Regression to develop a churn prediction model for the Telecom Industry. Churn refers to customers leaving a service, which is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By building a predictive model, this project assists telecom companies in identifying potential churners, enabling them to take proactive measures to retain these customers and improve overall customer retention.

## Key Features:

### 1. Logistic Regression Model: The project leverages the power of Logistic Regression, a widely used classification algorithm for binary prediction tasks like churn prediction. It efficiently predicts the likelihood of a customer churning based on historical data.

### 2.Data Preprocessing: The dataset is carefully processed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering to ensure the model's accuracy and robustness.

### 3.Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected to avoid overfitting and enhance model performance. Techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) or feature importance scores are employed.

### 4. Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC, among others.
